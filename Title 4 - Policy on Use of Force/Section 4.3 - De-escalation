SECTION 4.3 - DE-ESCALATION

      Officers will be trained in de-escalation tactics and techniques designed to gain voluntary compliance from a subject before using 
      force, and such tactics and techniques should be employed if objectively feasible and they would not increase the danger to the officer 
      or others. When feasible, reducing the need for force allows officers to secure their own safety as well as the safety of the public.
