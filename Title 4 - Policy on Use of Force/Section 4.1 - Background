SECTION 4.1 - BACKGROUND

      It is the policy of the Department of Justice to value and preserve human life. Officers may use only the force that is objectively 
      reasonable to effectively gain control of an incident, while protecting the safety of the officer and others, in keeping with the standards 
      set forth in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989). Officers may use force only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative 
      appears to exist and may use only the level of force that a reasonable officer on the scene would use under the same or similar circumstances.

      As the Supreme Court stated in Graham: The decision to use force "requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular 
      case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others, and 
      whether [the suspect] is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight." Id at 396. "The calculus of reasonableness must 
      embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, 
      and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation." Id at 396-97. In addition, "[t]he 'reasonableness' 
      of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of 
      hindsight." Id at 397. "[T]he question is whether the officers' actions are 'objectively reasonable' in light of the facts and circumstances 
      confronting them." Id

      This title emphasizes core principles and training standards for the DOJ law enforcement component agencies, which have updated their individual 
      use of force training programs regularly.
