SECTION 4.2 - DEADLY FORCE

      Law enforcement officers and correctional officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when 
      the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the 
      officer or to another person.

      A. Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect. 

      B. Firearms may not be discharged solely to disable moving vehicles. 
         Specifically, firearms may not be discharged at a moving vehicle unless: (1) a person in the vehicle is threatening the officer or another person 
         with deadly force by means other than the vehicle; or (2) the vehicle is operated in a manner that threatens to cause death or serious physical 
         injury to the officer or others, and no other objectively reasonable means of defense appear to exist, which includes moving out of the path of 
         the vehicle. Firearms may not be discharged from a moving vehicle except in exigent circumstances. In these situations, an officer must have an 
         articulable reason for this use of deadly force.

      C. If feasible and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal warning to submit to the authority of the officer 
         shall be given prior to the use of deadly force.

      D. Warning shots are not permitted outside of the prison context.

      E. Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects, which must be used when the use of deadly force is 
         not authorized by this policy.

      F. Deadly force should not be used against persons whose actions are a threat solely to themselves or property unless an individual poses an 
         imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others in close proximity.
