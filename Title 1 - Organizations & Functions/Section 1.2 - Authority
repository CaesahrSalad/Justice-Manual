SECTION 1.2 - AUTHORITY
  	The Justice Manual is prepared under the supervision of the Attorney General and direction of the Deputy Attorney General. 

  	When the Justice Manual conflicts with earlier DOJ statements of policy or procedure, the Justice Manual controls. 
  	Any questions about the controlling internal policy or procedure should be directed to the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

  	The Justice Manual provides internal DOJ guidance. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, 
    substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil or criminal. Nor are any limitations hereby placed on  
  	otherwise lawful litigation prerogatives of DOJ.
