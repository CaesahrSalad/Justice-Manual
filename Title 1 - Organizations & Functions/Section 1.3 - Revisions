SECTION 1.3 - REVISIONS
    The Justice Manual contains internal Department guidance that has been adopted through a policy-development process. This 
    provision explains how the Justice Manual is revised to reflect the policy changes adopted through that process.

  SUBSECTION 1.3A - EDITORS
    The Associate Attorney General, or other senior leadership official selected by the Attorney General, 
    shall serve as the Editor-in-Chief of the Justice Manual. The Editor-in-Chief shall review all substantive changes to the
    Justice Manual. Substantive changes to the Justice Manual require the approval of the Attorney General.

    An attorney in the Office of the Attorney General selected by the Deputy Attorney General shall serve as the Managing Editor.
    The Managing Editor shall chair the Justice Manual’s Board of Editors, oversee coordination of revisions to the Justice Manual, 
    and may approve any non-substantive, clerical changes to the Justice Manual.

    The Justice Manual Board of Editors, chaired by the Managing Editor, shall comprise approximately 20 officials, including at 
    least one senior employee from each of the following components and organizations: United States Attorneys Office, Office of
    the Inspector General, Office of the Solicitor General, Office of the Pardon Attorney and the Office of the Attorney General. 
    Additional components may submit requests to join the Board to the Managing Editor. At the request of the Managing Editor, the 
    Board will review and provide feedback, as warranted, on proposed changes to the Justice Manual or perform other tasks related 
    to the Justice Manual’s substance, review, and revision.

  SUBSECTION 1.3B - REVISION PROCESS
    Substantive Revisions Directed by a Department Leadership Principal - The Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, or
    the Associate Attorney General with the concurrence of the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General, may direct changes
    to the Justice Manual. The Managing Editor shall oversee implementation of the changes, which generally will include review by
    the Board of Editors before final approval by the Editor-in-Chief.

    Substantive Revisions Requested by a Component Head - The head of any component, or their designee, may request substantive changes 
    to the Justice Manual by providing a proposal to the Managing Editor. The proposal should include the proposed revision as well as 
    a memorandum that provides: (i) a summary of the proposed revision; (ii) an explanation of the reason for the revision; and (iii) a 
    description of any policy-development process that led to the proposed revision and the involvement of any Department leadership 
    office and other potentially affected component in that process.

    The Managing Editor shall review the proposal and consult with the Editor-in-Chief and other Department officials, as appropriate, 
    to determine whether additional policy development is required. If so, the Managing Editor will so inform the proposal sponsor and 
    return the proposal for completion of that process. If not, the Managing Editor will submit the proposal to the Justice Manual Board
    of Editors for review and comment. Absent exigent circumstances, the Managing Editor shall endeavor to provide at least two weeks for 
    consideration of proposed substantive changes to the Justice Manual by the Board of Editors.

    The Managing Editor shall oversee any additional revisions to the proposal and shall submit the proposal to the Editor-in-Chief at the 
    conclusion of the review process. Upon the Editor-in-Chief’s approval of the proposed change to the Justice Manual, the Managing Editor 
    shall oversee implementation of that change and publication of the revised Justice Manual provision online.

    Substantive Revisions Initiated by the Editor-in-Chief or Managing Editor - The Editor-in-Chief or the Managing Editor may initiate proposed
    changes to the Justice Manual. The Managing Editor, in consultation with the Editor-in-Chief and other Department officials, as appropriate, 
    will assign drafting responsibilities and determine what policy development is required. Once drafting of the change is complete, and the
    Managing Editor determines that no further policy development is required, the Managing Editor will submit the proposal to the Justice Manual
    Board of Editors for review and comment. Board review, additional proposal revision, and Editor-in-Chief approval shall follow the same process 
    described in Substantive Revisions Requested by a Component Head.

    Non-Substantive Changes - Non-substantive, clerical changes to the Justice Manual do not require review by the Board of Editors before incorporation. 
    Such changes should be shared with the Managing Editor, who may approve and oversee implementation of such changes.
