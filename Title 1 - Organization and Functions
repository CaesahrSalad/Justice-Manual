SECTION 1.1 - PURPOSE
	The Justice Manual publicly sets forth internal Department of Justice policies and procedures.

SECTION 1.2 - AUTHORITY
  	The Justice Manual is prepared under the supervision of the Attorney General and direction of the Deputy Attorney General. 

  	When the Justice Manual conflicts with earlier DOJ statements of policy or procedure, the Justice Manual controls. 
  	Any questions about the controlling internal policy or procedure should be directed to the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

  	The Justice Manual provides internal DOJ guidance. It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, 
 	substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil or criminal. Nor are any limitations hereby placed on  
  	otherwise lawful litigation prerogatives of DOJ.

SECTION 1.3 - REVISIONS
  	The Justice Manual contains internal Department guidance that has been adopted through a policy-development process. This provision
  	explains how the Justice Manual is revised to reflect the policy changes adopted through that process.

  	The Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, or other senior leadership official selected by the Deputy Attorney General, shall 
  	serve as the Editor-in-Chief of the Justice Manual. The Editor-in-Chief shall review all substantive changes to the Justice Manual.
  	Substantive changes to the Justice Manual require the approval of the Editor-in-Chief.
