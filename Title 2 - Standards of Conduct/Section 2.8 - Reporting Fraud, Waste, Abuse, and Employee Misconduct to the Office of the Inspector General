SECTION 2.8 - REPORTING FRAUD, WASTE, ABUSE, AND EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT TO THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

      The Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Justice is a statutorily created independent entity whose mission is to 
      detect and deter waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct in DOJ programs and personnel, and to promote economy and efficiency in those 
      programs. The OIG investigates alleged violations of criminal and civil laws, as well as applicable regulations and policies, by 
      DOJ employees and also audits and inspects DOJ programs. The Inspector General, who is appointed by the President subject to Senate 
      confirmation, reports to the Attorney General and Congress.

      Except with respect to attorney professional misconduct allegations, Department employees shall report to the OIG, to their appropriate 
      supervisor, or to their component’s office any evidence or non-frivolous allegation of: a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order;
      waste, fraud, or abuse; or criminal or serious administrative misconduct, or an investigation of allegations of criminal misconduct against
      any Department employee. If a Department employee reports an allegation of misconduct to a supervisor in the first instance, the supervisor 
      shall evaluate whether the allegation at issue is non-frivolous, and, if so, the supervisor shall report it, through the component, to the OIG. 
      See 28 C.F.R. § 0.29(b), (c). If the evidence or allegation concerns an OUSA employee, the supervisor also shall notify the United States 
      Attorneys Office and the Associate Attorney General.

      Nothing in this section or Component policies and procedures should be interpreted to preclude an employee’s ability to report misconduct 
      directly to OIG.  Allegations of misconduct may be reported to the Office of the Inspector General by opening a ticket in the Department of 
      Justice discord.
