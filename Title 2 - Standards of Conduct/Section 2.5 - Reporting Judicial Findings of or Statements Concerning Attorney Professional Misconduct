SECTION 2.5 - REPORTING JUDICIAL FINDINGS OF OR STATEMENTS CONCERNING ATTORNEY PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT

      Department attorneys shall report to their supervisors any statement by a judge or magistrate indicating a belief that misconduct 
      by a Department attorney has occurred, or taking under submission a claim of misconduct. Supervisors shall report to the Associate
      Attorney General any evidence or non-frivolous allegation of misconduct that is of a serious nature.

      Whenever a judge or magistrate makes a finding of misconduct by a Department attorney or requests an inquiry by the Department into 
      possible misconduct, the employee shall immediately report the finding or request to the employee's supervisor and to the Associate
      Attorney General, regardless of whether the matter is regarded as serious or is the subject of additional litigation.

      After a matter has been reported to the OAAG, the employee or supervisor who reported the matter, or other appropriate supervisor, 
      must apprise the Attorney Generals Office of any significant developments, including relevant pleadings, hearings, or rulings by the 
      court.
