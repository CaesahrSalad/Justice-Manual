SECTION 2.6 - LITIGATION CONCERNING ATTORNEY PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS

      Before any pleading or other document concerning any non-frivolous allegation of misconduct by an attorney is filed, whether in
      the district court or on appeal, it must be reviewed by a supervisor who is not implicated by the allegation.
 
      A Department attorney who is found to have engaged in professional misconduct in a particular case shall not continue to represent
      the United States in that case unless approval is obtained from the responsible United States Attorney or Associate Attorney General+.
