SECTION 2.4 - REPORTING ATTORNEY PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT AND RELATED LAW ENFORCEMENT MISCONDUCT

      Department employees shall report to their supervisor any evidence or non-frivolous allegation that a Department attorney engaged 
      in professional misconduct. Department employees also shall report to their supervisor any evidence or non-frivolous allegations of 
      misconduct against Department law enforcement personnel that relate to allegations of attorney misconduct within the jurisdiction of OAG.
      Misconduct constitutes professional misconduct when it relates to an attorneyâ€™s responsibility to investigate, litigate, or provide legal 
      advice. The supervisor shall evaluate whether the allegation is non-frivolous and the misconduct is of a serious nature; if so, the supervisor 
      shall report the allegation to the Associate Attorney General or higher.  An employee may also report misconduct allegations directly to their 
      supervisor. If the evidence or allegation concerns an Assistant United States Attorney, the supervisor also shall notify the United States 
      Attorneys Office.

      If the supervisor was involved in the alleged misconduct, the supervisor must bring the evidence or non-frivolous allegation of misconduct to 
      the attention of a higher-ranking official such as the Deputy Attorney General or Attorney General regardless of whether the supervisor believes 
      the misconduct to be of a serious nature.

      The decision whether to conduct an investigation of a former employee is made on a case-by-case basis. The Associate Attorney General obtains 
      the approval from the Office of the  Attorney General before declining to investigate or terminating an investigation on the ground that an employee 
      has left the Department.
