SECTION 2.2 - OBTAINING ADVICE AND APPROVAL ON ETHICS-RELATED MATTERS
      The Government ethics rules are administered within every federal agency by a Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO), who is 
      responsible for the agency’s ethics program.  At the Department, the DAEO is the Associate Attorney General. The DAEO has authority 
      to appoint Deputy Designated Agency Ethics Officials who assist the DAEO by managing the ethics program within their components. 

      The Ethics Official’s role includes counseling employees on avoiding Government ethics violations.  In many cases, employees must 
      consult with the DAEO before engaging in certain activities. The Ethics Official will make a formal recommendation for approval of 
      the activity that requires a determination of the component head or designee, as set forth in DOJ Order 1200.1. Decisions requiring 
      formal approval by component heads or designees with the recommendation of the Ethics Official include: waivers of a financial interest;
      approval of acceptance of travel reimbursement by non-federal sources (see 41 C.F.R. Part 304); determinations that an employee’s 
      participation in a specific party matter is appropriate, notwithstanding that a reasonable person could question the impartiality of 
      the employee, and authorizing the employee to so act; acceptance of certain awards; attendance at “widely attended gatherings” when 
      attendance includes receipt of a gift (often free registration or meals); and approval of outside employment that is related to the subject 
      matter of the employee’s component
      
      Likewise, while also not an exhaustive list, an employee should contact his or her designated Ethics Official for advice or approval when
      the employee: is offered a gift in connection with his or her job from a person or entity outside the government, and especially when the 
      offer involves an award, the payment of money, or free attendance at any event; seeks to give a gift to a superior or accept a gift from a 
      subordinate; is assigned a matter in which his or her official actions may affect the employee's own financial interest or the interest of 
      any person or entity whose interests are imputed to the employee; is asked to participate in a matter that might cause a reasonable person
      to question his or her impartiality; might realize private gain through the use of his or her official position, non-public information, 
      government property, or official time; engages in outside employment or other outside activity that may conflict with his or her official
      duties; including teaching, speaking, or writing; or seeks employment outside the federal government.
    
      Department attorneys have the additional responsibility of complying with applicable rules of professional conduct outlined in the ULPA
      Code of Ethics. When in doubt about a professional responsibility obligation, Department attorneys should consult with a supervisor.

      Disciplinary action for violating a provision of 5 C.F.R. Parts 2635 or 3801, or applicable bar rules, will not be taken by the Department 
      against an employee who has engaged in conduct in good faith reliance upon the advice of the Ethics Official, provided the employee 
      has made full disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances and followed completely the advice given. Advice and recommendations, 
      and approvals made by Ethics Officials are based solely on the information provided by the employee and may be invalid if the employee provides
      inaccurate or incomplete information.  Employees remain subject to discipline for misconduct not covered by the Ethics Official’s. 
      Reliance on any other individual, such as a private attorney, will not shield an employee from discipline. Further, when the employee’s conduct 
      violates a criminal statute, reliance on the advice of the Ethics Official cannot ensure the employee will not be prosecuted. Such reliance 
      is, however, a factor considered by the Department in selection of such cases for prosecution.
