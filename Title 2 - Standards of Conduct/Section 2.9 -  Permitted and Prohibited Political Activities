SECTION 2.9 - PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

      All Department of Justice employees are subject to this policy, which  prohibits Department employees from engaging in partisan
      political activity while on duty, in a DOJ facility or using DOJ property.  Political activity is activity directed toward the 
      success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. The policy carries
      serious penalties including REMOVAL from federal employment.

      The Hatch Act applies to all federal employees; however it was voided here in this group, however we will be enforcing internal 
      policy in which its application of its restrictions is broken down into two groups, based on position.

      Less restricted employees, including most career employees in the executive branch, are able to participate actively in political
      management or partisan political campaigns, while off-duty, outside a federal facility and not using federal property.

      Further restricted employees are held to stricter rules that preclude active participation in political management or partisan political 
      campaigns, even off-duty. The following Department of Justice employees are "further restricted" by statute: all Senior Executive Service 
      employees; senior DOJ employees; employees in the Criminal Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Security Division; 
      and criminal investigators. Further restricted employees may not campaign for or against candidates or otherwise engage in political activity
      in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

      Considering the Department’s mission, it has been determined that, as a matter of Department policy, all political appointees will be subject
      to the rules that govern “further restricted” employees to ensure there is not an appearance that politics plays any part in the Department’s 
      day to day operations. 

  SUBSECTION 2.9A - LESS RESTRICTED EMPLOYEES PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

      Less Restricted Employees are permitted to be candidates for public office in nonpartisan elections, register and vote as they choose, assist 
      in voter registration drives, contribute money to political campaigns, political parties or partisan political groups, attend political fundraising 
      functions, attend and be active at political rallies and meetings, join and be an active member of political clubs or parties, hold office in
      political clubs and parties, sign and circulate nominating petitions, campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections, make campaign
      speeches for candidates in partisan elections, distribute campaign literature in partisan elections, volunteer to work on a partisan political 
      campaign, express opinions about candidates and issues (if the expression is political activity directed at the success or failure of a political 
      party, candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group, the expression is not permitted while the employee is on duty, in any
      federal room or building, while wearing a uniform or official insignia or using any federally-owned or leased vehicle).

      Less Restircted Employees are prohibited from using their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election, 
      e.g.: may not use official title/position while engaged in political activity and may not invite subordinate employees to political events or 
      otherwise suggest to subordinates that they attend political events or undertake any partisan political activity, furthmore solicit, accept, or 
      receive a donation or contribution for a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group, e.g.:
      may not host a political fundraiser, may not invite others to a political fundraiser, may not collect contributions or issue invities to political 
      fundraising functions., be candidates for public office in partisan political elections (In certain designated communities, including the Washington 
      DC suburbs, an employee may run for office in a local partisan election but only as an independent candidate and may receive, but not solicit, 
      contributions 5 C.F.R. § 733.101-107. Knowingly solicit or discourage the participation in any political activity of anyone who has business pending 
      before their employing office (The only statutory exception is for soliciting, accepting or receiving a political contribution to a multi-candidate 
      political committee from a fellow member of a federal labor organization or certain other employee organizations, as long as the solicited employee 
      is not a subordinate and the activity does not violate the restrictions noted below). Engage in political activity while on duty, in a federal facility, 
      wearing a uniform or official insignia, or using a federally-owned or leased vehicle, e.g: may not wear political buttons/T shirts/signs, may not 
      display/distribute campaign materials, may not perform campaign-related chores, may not make political contributions, may not post a comment to a 
      blog or social media site advocating for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group
      may not use any email account or social media to distribute, send, or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan political party, 
      candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.

SUBSECTION 2.9B - FURTHER RESTRICTED EMPLOYEES PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

      campaigns where none of the candidates represent a political party, contribute money to political campaigns, political parties, or partisan political

      political activity), act as recorder, watcher, challenger, or similar officer at polling places in consultation or coordination with a political

      further restricted employees may not post links to websites created by or leading to information created by a political party, partisan candidate, or 
      campaign).

SUBSECTION 2.9C - SOCIAL MEDIA

      As a general matter, the Department of Justice authorizes some limited personal use of government time and equipment, including social media, where 
      there is negligible cost to the government and no interference with official business.  However, partisan political activity in the workplace is 
      treated differently than other personal use activities.  Since partisan political activity in the workplace is prohibited by this policy, employees
      may not use social media or any other government equipment to engage in partisan political activities.

      Federal employees retain the right to have and express personal opinions about candidates, elections and political parties outside of the workplace, 
      using their personal social media accounts, etc.  However, they need to have a heightened awareness of what they can and cannot post on a social media
      site.  DOJE Employees on social media sites must be careful that they set and monitor their privacy and other social media settings so that postings to
      their sites do not link political commentary with their DOJ title or position.

      Most employees are “less restricted” under this policy and may be active in partisan political activity while not on duty or in a federal facility. 
      Those who are “further restricted” include employees in the career Senior Executive Service, DOJ Administration, National Security Division, Criminal 
      Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation,and all political appointees.

      The following list of permitted and prohibited activities will help employees decipher what they may and may not do in terms of political activity 
      using social media.  The most important overarching policy restrictions to always keep in mind when using social media are: (1) no partisan political 
      activity while on duty, in a federal facility, wearing a uniform or official insignia, or using a government vehicle; (2) no soliciting, accepting or
      receiving political contributions at any time; and (3) no use of official authority or influence, including use of official title, to affect the result
      of an election. 

      In many cases, most DOJ employees MAY . . . (but, please note specific additional limits) write a blog expressing support of or opposition to 
      partisan political candidates or parties (note:  not while on duty, in a federal facility; no use of official title in connection with the blog; 
      no soliciting, accepting or receiving political contributions through blog; further restricted employees:  cannot take an active part in partisan 
      political management and campaigns; therefore, cannot post anything on a blog that was created by or leads to information created by the party, 
      partisan candidate or campaign), List official title, forward a political email from an employee’s government email to employee’s own personal email 
      address (note: an employee cannot then forward the email from the personal address to others while on duty, in a federal facility, etc., even if 
      using employee’s own social media), Campaign for or against a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan public office on 
      a twitter page (note:  not on duty, in a federal facility; no soliciting/accepting/receiving campaign contributions; can’t use official position to 
      bolster the statements posted; supervisors may never send to subordinate employees an email or social media post directed at the success or failure 
      of a political party, partisan political group or partisan candidate; therefore, messages and posts must not be sent to an exclusive group that 
      includes subordinates but to all followers, friends; further restricted:  no posting links to political web sites in any case, post a link to the
      website of a political party, partisan candidate, or partisan political group on a social media page or blog (note: not while on duty, in a federal 
      facility; no soliciting/accepting/receiving campaign contributions; link can’t lead directly to donation/contribution page; further restricted: no 
      posting links to political web sites), become a “friend”, “fan” or “like” the social media page of a political party, partisan political group or 
      partisan candidate (note: not while on duty, in a federal facility; no soliciting/accepting/receiving campaign contributions; further restricted:  
      must adjust privacy settings so that lists of “friends” “likes” “interests” and “pages” with links are visible only to the employee) or follow any 
      social media account of a political party, partisan political group, or partisan candidate’s campaign (note: no soliciting/accepting/receiving 
      campaign contributions, not while on duty, in a federal facility; further restricted: only if employee’s list of whom he follows is hidden from 
      his own friends and followers)

SUBSECTION 2.9D - CANDIDATE PHOTOGRAPHS

      Displaying pictures of candidates for partisan political office in the federal workplace is considered engaging in political activity and barred
      by this policy. This applies to the President, who is a candidate for re-election. Therefore, DOJ employees may not display pictures of the President 
      UNLESS: it is a single copy of the official portrait of the President displayed in a traditional manner; OR it is an official photo of the President 
      at an official government event, such as a ribbon-cutting or bill-signing (newspaper, magazine photos of official events do not qualify). In addition 
      to the two exceptions noted above for the display of Presidential candidate photographs, DOJ employees may not display pictures of any partisan 
      candidate UNLESS: the photo was on display in advance of the election season; and the employee is in the photo; and the photo is a personal one 
      (depicting a personal relationship, such as attendance at a wedding), and the employee has no political purpose in displaying the photograph.

SUBSECTION 2.9E - RUNNING FOR OFFICE

      If a DOJ employee runs for public office, the DOJ  employee should notify the Agency Ethics Official.  The ethics official can then advise the 
      employee as to the ethics rules that pertain to that circumstance.  Donations to campaigns are among the issues that arise when a DOJ employee
      runs for office.  DOJ employees must remain mindful that a perception of bias can arise if donors to the campaign have some connection to matters
      in which the DOJ employee is participating in his or her official capacity.  Employees therefore have a duty to regularly review lists of donors, 
      identifying any that could raise appearance issues.  Employees must consider whether donors are prohibited sources under the gift rules, 5 CFR 
      Section 2635.201, et seq., and whether the donation raises concerns under the “catch-all” provision in 5 CFR Section 2635.502.  Employees should
      contact the Agency Ethics Official when these questions arise in order to discuss appropriate next steps.
