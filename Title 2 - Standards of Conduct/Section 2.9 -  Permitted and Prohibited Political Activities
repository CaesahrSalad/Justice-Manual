SECTION 2.9 - PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED POLITICAL ACTIVITIES

      All Department of Justice employees are subject to this policy, which  prohibits Department employees from engaging in partisan
      political activity while on duty, in a DOJ facility or using DOJ property.  Political activity is activity directed toward the 
      success or failure of a political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. The policy carries
      serious penalties including REMOVAL from federal employment.

      The Hatch Act applies to all federal employees; however it was voided here in this group, however we will be enforcing internal 
      policy in which its application of its restrictions is broken down into two groups, based on position.

      Less restricted employees, including most career employees in the executive branch, are able to participate actively in political
      management or partisan political campaigns, while off-duty, outside a federal facility and not using federal property.

      Further restricted employees are held to stricter rules that preclude active participation in political management or partisan political 
      campaigns, even off-duty. The following Department of Justice employees are "further restricted" by statute: all Senior Executive Service 
      employees; senior DOJ employees; employees in the Criminal Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Security Division; 
      and criminal investigators. Further restricted employees may not campaign for or against candidates or otherwise engage in political activity
      in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

      Considering the Department’s mission, it has been determined that, as a matter of Department policy, all political appointees will be subject
      to the rules that govern “further restricted” employees to ensure there is not an appearance that politics plays any part in the Department’s 
      day to day operations. 

      Less Restricted Employees are permitted to be candidates for public office in nonpartisan elections, register and vote as they choose, assist 
      in voter registration drives, contribute money to political campaigns, political parties or partisan political groups, attend political fundraising 
      functions, attend and be active at political rallies and meetings, join and be an active member of political clubs or parties, hold office in
      political clubs and parties, sign and circulate nominating petitions, campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections, make campaign
      speeches for candidates in partisan elections, distribute campaign literature in partisan elections, volunteer to work on a partisan political 
      campaign, express opinions about candidates and issues (if the expression is political activity directed at the success or failure of a political 
      party, candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group, the expression is not permitted while the employee is on duty, in any
      federal room or building, while wearing a uniform or official insignia or using any federally-owned or leased vehicle).

      Less Restircted Employees are prohibited from using their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election, 
      e.g.: may not use official title/position while engaged in political activity and may not invite subordinate employees to political events or 
      otherwise suggest to subordinates that they attend political events or undertake any partisan political activity, furthmore solicit, accept, or 
      receive a donation or contribution for a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group, e.g.:
      may not host a political fundraiser, may not invite others to a political fundraiser, may not collect contributions or issue invities to political 
      fundraising functions., be candidates for public office in partisan political elections (In certain designated communities, including the Washington 
      DC suburbs, an employee may run for office in a local partisan election but only as an independent candidate and may receive, but not solicit, 
      contributions 5 C.F.R. § 733.101-107. Knowingly solicit or discourage the participation in any political activity of anyone who has business pending 
      before their employing office (The only statutory exception is for soliciting, accepting or receiving a political contribution to a multi-candidate 
      political committee from a fellow member of a federal labor organization or certain other employee organizations, as long as the solicited employee 
      is not a subordinate and the activity does not violate the restrictions noted below). Engage in political activity while on duty, in a federal facility, 
      wearing a uniform or official insignia, or using a federally-owned or leased vehicle, e.g: may not wear political buttons/T shirts/signs, may not 
      display/distribute campaign materials, may not perform campaign-related chores, may not make political contributions, may not post a comment to a 
      blog or social media site advocating for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group
      may not use any email account or social media to distribute, send, or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan political party, 
      candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group.

      Further restricted employees are permitted to register and vote as they choose, assist in non-partisan voter registration drives, participate in 
      campaigns where none of the candidates represent a political party, contribute money to political campaigns, political parties, or partisan political
      groups, attend political fund raising functions (but not non-career appointees), attend political rallies and meetings (but not non-career appointees),
