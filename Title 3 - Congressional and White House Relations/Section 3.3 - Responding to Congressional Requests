SECTION 3.3 - RESPONDING TO CONGRESSIONAL REQUEST

      Except as expressly provided in this section, all congressional member and staff contacts with Department employees, attorneys, offices, 
      boards, divisions, and components, including in-person contacts and contacts by dm, email, or any other means, must be reported promptly 
      to the Associate Attorney General and the component’s designated congressional liaison, if applicable, before any response.

      The Associate Attorney General will manage congressional correspondence, coordinating with the Department’s Executive Secretariat, leadership 
      offices, and components as appropriate. The Associate Attorney General will review prior to transmittal all Departmental written communications 
      to Congress, including letters, responses to Questions for the Record, briefing papers, talking points, slide presentations, and any other 
      materials intended for submission or presentation on Capitol Hill.  Likewise, the Associate Attorney General will manage the clearance process 
      through which legislative proposals and views are considered by Department components prior to the Department’s views on those matters being 
      communicated to Congress.  

      In order to ensure that Congress may carry out its legitimate investigatory and oversight functions, the Department will use its best efforts 
      to respond as appropriate to inquiries from Congress consistent with policies, laws, regulations, and professional ethical obligations that may 
      require confidentiality.  Because it is important that the Department provide timely responses to congressional inquiries when possible, components 
      should make it a priority to assist the Associate Attorney General in this regard. 

      In general, other than letters assigned for direct response by the component, letters to Congress and committees should be prepared by the relevant 
      component and sent by the Associate Attorney General.  Accordingly, when incoming congressional correspondence is circulated to components likely to
      have responsive information or equities in the subject matter, it is incumbent upon each component’s leadership to ensure the accuracy and completeness 
      of these responses to Congress.  Specifically, (1) rigorous efforts must be undertaken to obtain information from Department personnel with the most 
      direct knowledge of the subject matter; (2) component managers are responsible for the accuracy of the information provided to the Associate Atorney
      General, and therefore should review and clear any congressional response prepared by subordinates; and (3) accuracy always takes priority over any 
      requested deadline.

      Department employees should follow these standards in both open and closed cases, and must never provide information on (1) pending investigations; 
      (2) closed investigations that did not become public; (3) grand jury, tax, or other restricted information; or (4) matters that would reveal the 
      identity of confidential informants, sensitive investigative techniques, deliberative processes, the reasoning behind the exercise of prosecutorial 
      discretion, or the identity of individuals who may have been investigated, but not indicted.  All requests for these types of information should be 
      referred to the Associate Attorney General, as well as any congressional request that implicates Privacy Act considerations.

  SUBSECTION 3.3A - RESPONDING TO CONGRESSIONAL REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION

      Department employees may respond to congressional requests without first contacting the Associate Attorney General when the request is for public 
      information, as defined below, only.  Congressional requests for public information must be reported to the Associate Attorney General only if: (1) 
      the congressional request is in letter form (including letters delivered by fax or email); (2) the Member of Congress or staff expresses any opinion 
      about the nature, status, or propriety of any government action or inaction; (3) the Member of Congress or staff suggests any government action or 
      inaction; or (4) the context or nature of the congressional contact creates the appearance that the Member of Congress or staff seeks any government 
      action or inaction.

      Public information includes: administrative information, documents that are already part of public court records and not under seal or otherwise
      restricted, such as filed indictments, briefs, etc. News releases or other materials meant for public distribution. The time and place for the next 
      public court hearing, if already announced.

      Note that repeated requests for public information from the same Member of Congress or staff, or from different Members of Congress or staff concerning 
      the same matter or case, should be promptly reported to the Associate Attorney General.  If you are unsure if certain information should be released, 
      or whether it is proper to give certain assistance requested, please contact the Associate Attorney General.
