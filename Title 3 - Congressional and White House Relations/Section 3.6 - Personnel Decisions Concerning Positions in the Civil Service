SECTION 3.6 - PERSONNEL DECISIONS CONCERNING POSITIONS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE

      All personnel decisions regarding career positions in the Department must be made without regard to the applicant’s or occupant’s partisan 
      affiliation. Thus, while the Department regularly receives communications from the White House and from Senators, Members of Congress, and their 
      staffs concerning political appointments, such communications regarding positions in the career service are not proper when they concern a job 
      applicant’s or a job holder’s partisan affiliation. Efforts to influence personnel decisions concerning career positions on partisan grounds 
      should be reported to the Associate Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General.
