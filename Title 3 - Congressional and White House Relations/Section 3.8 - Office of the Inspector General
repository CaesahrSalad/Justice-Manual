SECTION 3.8 - OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

      Consistent with the independence of its operations under the Inspector General Act of 1978, OIG is exempt from the requirements of this 
      Chapter regarding congressional contacts, requests, and approvals, legislative requests or proposals, and GAO contacts. OIG should, 
      however, timely inform the Attorney General, or the Deputy Attorney General upon delegation, about any significant congressional issues 
      in matters handled by OIG.
