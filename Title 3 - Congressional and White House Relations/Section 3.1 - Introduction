SECTION 3.1 - INTRODUCTION

      The rule of law depends upon the evenhanded administration of justice.  The legal judgments of the Department of Justice must be
      impartial and insulated from political influence.  It is imperative that the Department’s investigatory and prosecutorial powers 
      be exercised free from partisan consideration.  It is a fundamental duty of every employee of the Department to ensure that these 
      principles are upheld in all of the Department’s legal endeavors.

      In order to promote the rule of law and to ensure that the Department’s actions are free from the appearance of political influence, 
      this title sets out guidelines to govern all communications between representatives of the Department and representatives of Congress, 
      and procedures intended to implement those guidelines.
