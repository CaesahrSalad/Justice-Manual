SECTION 3.2 - COMMUNICATIONS WITH CONGRESS

    The Associate Attorney General is responsible for communications between Congress and the Department under the authority of the Attorney General 
    and the direction of the Deputy Attorney General. Communications between the Department and Congress, including those pertaining to policy,
    legislation, political appointments, nominations, intergovernmental and public liaison relations, cases and investigations, and administrative 
    matters, will be managed or coordinated by the Associate Attorney General to ensure that relevant Department or Executive Branch interests are 
    fully protected. Communication between the Associate Attorney General and Department components may be aided by designated component or law
    enforcement congressional liaisons, as appropriate.  However, all component and law enforcement congressional liaisons will follow the direction 
    of the Associate Attorney General with regard to communications with Congress.  

    Except as provided in this chapter, no Department employee may communicate with Senators, Representatives, congressional committees, or congressional 
    staff without advance coordination, consultation, and approval by the Associate Attorney General or higher.  All congressional inquiries and 
    correspondence from Members, committees, and staff should be immediately directed to the Associate Attorney General upon receipt.  The Associate 
    Attorney General, in consultation with the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, will determine how best to proceed on particular legislative
    and oversight matters, including timing, presentation, and selection of Department witnesses to appear before congressional committees.  This policy
    includes requests from Congress for technical and advisory assistance on legislative language or bill text.  OLA will also accompany Departmental and 
    component representatives when they represent the Department at hearings, briefings, and meetings with Members of Congress, committees, and staff.
