SECTION 3.7 - WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS

    Nothing in this title is intended to conflict with or limit whistleblower protections, such as those provided in 5 U.S.C. §§ 2302-2303 and 
    applicable regulations. Rather, the provisions of this Policy “are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter 
    the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1) classified information, (2) 
    communications to Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a 
    gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or (4) any other whistleblower 
    protection. The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by controlling Executive orders and statutory 
    provisions are incorporated into this [Title] and are controlling.”
